3. **Create Reports**:
   Use Power BI's drag-and-drop functionality to create the required visuals and reports such as sales overviews, customer insights, product performance, and geographical analysis.

4. **Publish to Power BI Service (Optional)**:
   Once your reports are ready, you can optionally publish them to the Power BI Service for online access and sharing with stakeholders.
